        <h2> FAQs </h2>

        <details>
            <summary>How soon can my website launch</summary>
            <p>Most of our sites run in the $3,000-$5,000 range, but can be more or less depending on the complexity of the project.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How much input do I have in the web design process?</summary>
            <p>It’s crucial that we receive your input and feedback in the web design process and testing phase. When we start collaborating with a new client for a new website, we will provide a link to an online brief questionnaire that will ask for information about your industry, business goals, competitors, target audience and your likes and dislikes. This information helps us create a website that you will love, but also that your end-users will love too. We will also make suggestions on the website architecture and recommend functionality to meet your business and client needs.

                Once the site architecture is approved, we start the design process and will be communicating with you often. We will send you layouts to review and may ask questions to confirm content. This is where it’s crucial that we get your emails responses in a timely manner and feedback concerning the designs. Once all web page designs are approved, we start development. Once the newly developed site is ready for review, we will require your time again to review the live beta site and provide feedback.

        <details>
            <summary>Who provides the content for the new website?</summary>
            <p>If you have a current website, we can pull the content from there. If it’s a new business, we will require the content to come from you.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How do we communicate during the web design and development process?</summary>
            <p>After our initial scheduled call to discuss your website needs and answer any questions, most of the communication will take place over email. We can schedule periodic calls to discuss ideas, however our preference is to use email which documents all of the questions, information and requested changes, that way nothing gets missed.
