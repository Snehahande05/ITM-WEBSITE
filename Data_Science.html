            <summary>What Is a Decision Tree?</summary>
            <p>Decision trees are a tool used to classify data and determine the possibility of defined outcomes in a system. The base of the tree is known as the root node. The root node branches out into decision nodes based on the various decisions that can be made at each stage. Decision nodes flow into lead nodes, which represent the consequence of each decision. </p>

            <summary>What Is Pruning in a Decision Tree Algorithm?</summary>
            <p>Pruning a decision tree is the process of eliminating non-critical subtrees so that the data under consideration is not overfitted. In pre-pruning, the tree is pruned as it is being constructed, following criteria like the Gini index or information gain metrics. Post-pruning entails pruning a tree from the bottom up after it has been constructed.</p>
